# NekoSpeak #

![](https://github.com/catlinman/neko-config/blob/master/teamspeak/preview.png)

This is my personal TeamSpeak theme which uses my main design scheme and
specification that I share across many of my day to day applications.

____

Quick summary of the main interface features:
- Dark theme that resides on the darker side of things
- Consistent design across all application interfaces
- Contrasted icons with visible highlights and easy grepping
- More spacious and breathable design for most elements and containers
- Core server group and channel icon remakes

This theme's primary intention is bringing a bit of new life to the somewhat
dated TeamSpeak core interface, while still retaining the structure that is
familiar to most of us.

## Installation ##

### TeamSpeak Application ###

This is the toughest one. Just press install.

### TeamSpeak Website ###

Simply hit the *download button* to download the style. From there, open the
TeamSpeak style add-on with the application for it to be automatically
installed.

### GitHub ###

Simply clone or download this repository and then move the directories within
*teamspeak* to your application data TeamSpeak directory. The folder structures
should be kept the same. After that, the theme should be available as both a
style and an icon pack within your preferences.

## Icons ##

This add-on in itself contains a corresponding icon pack of the same name
making installation hassle free. Feel free to use your own though but keep in
mind the icons were made with the contrasted highlights in mind!

## Source ##

The theme itself has been well documented and segmented as much as possible and
uses a core set of variables and color declarations that should easily allow
you to search and replace instances within the source code. This way, simple
modifications of highlights and accents should come with ease without breaking
much of the theme itself.

Speaking of which: If you're interested in my other themes and configurations,
head over to my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/catlinman/). You'll also
find the source mirror of this style there as well within my personal
[neko-config](https://github.com/catlinman/neko-config) repository!

## License & Attribution ##

As is specifically stated in the source of this theme as well; this theme takes
major inspiration and conventions from other themes such as
[DarkenTS](https://www.myteamspeak.com/addons/686209af-0b66-4805-b2d7-0e990f7cb9e0)
by *Brady_The*, as well as the fork of that theme titled
[Demus](https://www.myteamspeak.com/addons/3bfce85f-bed4-4b04-a183-41b2b42107b4)
by *GrumpyDemus*. Furthermore, it uses some code from the original *Hivecom*
TeamSpeak skin which was based on *Steam Skin* by Adante.

The icon pack is based on a selection of icons ranging from material design
derived ones with now contrasted edges, remakes of the original Steam icon pack
and completely new icons custom made to fit the theme.

There is no license since this theme builds on derivatives from many others
over the years. Feel free to edit and redistribute the theme as you see fit.
