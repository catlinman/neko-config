# Neko Config

Neko Config is a legacy repository containing a large collection of public configuration files,
application themes, and syntax highlighting settings for different tools.

Over time, parts of this repository have been split out into more the more focused [zealsprince/.dotfiles](https://github.com/zealsprince/.dotfiles) repository (CLI-focused, e.g. Vim/Zsh/Tmux) managed as a standalone repo.

This repo remains useful for application-specific configs, themes, and templates that aren’t actively managed
as “real dotfiles” anymore.

## What's included?

- Atom configuration
- SublimeText 3 SyncSettings configuration
- Blender startup and configuration file
- TeamSpeak NekoSpeak skin and icon pack
- cmder setup with mintty and wsltty running zsh
- Terminator terminal profile configuration
- SSH configuration with 2FA and public keys
- Postfix, Dovecot, SpamAssassin, DKIM & DMARC
- LetsEncrypt quick setups and systemd service
- Fail2Ban configuration with additional suggestions
- Adobe application workspaces
- Krita theme and workspaces
- nginx configuration
- Syncplay systemd service
- Uncrustify setup for C-Languages
- PHP Code Beautifier and Fixer configuration (phpcbf)
- GoAccess Service & nginx Proxy Setup
- CS:GO autoexec configuration

### Note on “real dotfiles”

The actively used CLI dotfiles have moved to:

- `zealsprince/.dotfiles` — Zsh, Vim, Tmux, and user scripts (`bin/`)

Those files live in the `.dotfiles` repo and should be used from there going forward.
